Atom is a 32-bit embedded-class processor based on the [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/) Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). It is designed to be light on hardware resources and still powerful enough to be deployed in most embedded class applications.

Key highlights of Atom are listed below:

- Implements RV32I + M(optional) ISA as defined in the [RISC-V unprivileged ISA manual](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/download/Ratified-IMAFDQC/riscv-spec-20191213.pdf).

- Simple 2-stage pipelined architecture, ideal for smaller FPGAs.

- Wishbone ready CPU interface.

- Interactive RTL simulator AtomSim.

- Wide range of example programs.

- Open source under [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).
